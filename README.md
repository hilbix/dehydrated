# Retired fork

As Debian now contains `dehydrated` as package and I trust Debian and hence the Debian Maintainers, this fork (to track changes on `dehydrated`) can be retired.

I stopped to follow the changes before ACMEv2 was in place, so this variant here stopped working with LetsEncrypt anyways.

However ..

.. [in the Wiki](../../wiki/) I have some **notes on how to use `dehydrated` on Debian** Buster and above (and probably will keep this updated when I need to change something).

If there issues with what I write in the Wiki you still can open an issue here.  Perhaps I listen.
